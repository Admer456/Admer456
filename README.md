My interests include game & engine programming, GUI tools, VR, making Half-Life modding great again, and a bunch of other non-code stuff, such as electronics, music and driving simulators.

I mainly do stuff in **C#** and **C++**. I am currently studying software engineering at the [Faculty of Information Technologies](https://www.fit.ba/) in Mostar, as well as doing some freelance work in Source and Unreal.

Check out my cool projects:
* [**Elegy Engine**](https://github.com/ElegyEngine) - retro FPS game engine
    - C#, MIT-licenced
    - Early work in progress, please check back in 2025 for demos!
* [**Half-Life ADM**](https://github.com/Admer456/halflife-adm) - mod base for Half-Life
