My interests include engine programming, game programming, GUI tools, making Half-Life modding great again, and a bunch of other non-code stuff, such as electronics and music making. *Portfolio website coming sometime soon!*

I also have a [small blog](https://microfox.dev/). That way you can always know what I'm up to!

I mainly do stuff in **C#** and **C++**. I am currently studying software engineering at the [Faculty of Information Technologies](https://www.fit.ba/) in Mostar, as well as doing some freelance work in Source and Unreal.

Check out my cool projects:
* [**Elegy Engine**](https://github.com/ElegyEngine) - retro FPS game engine
    - C#, MIT-licenced, currently using Godot as a backend
    - Early work in progress, please check back in 2024 for demos!
* [**ScriptingMachine4**](https://github.com/Admer456/ScriptingMachine4) - research in C# scripting for C++ apps
* [**Half-Life ADM**](https://github.com/Admer456/halflife-adm) - mod base for Half-Life
    - Early work in progress, check back in 2024!

I've contributed to:
* [**TrenchBroom**](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom) - an intuitive level editor for Quake games and engines
    - Default entity property handling ([initiated](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/pull/3941), [finalised](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/pull/4164))
* [**Vookoo**](https://github.com/andy-thomason/Vookoo) - a C++ Vulkan abstraction library
    - Fixes for examples ([merged](https://github.com/andy-thomason/Vookoo/pull/45))

Here's some discontinued but still kinda neat projects of mine:
* [**BurekTech X**](https://github.com/Admer456/btx-engine) - discontinued in favour of Elegy
    - C++ MIT-licenced retro FPS game engine
* [**BUREKTech**](https://github.com/Admer456/ioq3-burek) - discontinued in favour of BurekTech X
    - C++ GPL2-licenced FPS game engine, based on ioquake3
    - Was used to make a [game demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYP1LTfNuk&t=1668s)
