I am currently studying software engineering at the [Faculty of Information Technologies](https://www.fit.ba/) in Mostar.

Check out my cool projects:
* [**Half-Life ADM**](https://github.com/Admer456/halflife-adm)
    - Mod base for Half-Life, adding lots of entities for mappers
* [**ScriptingMachine4**](https://github.com/Admer456/ScriptingMachine4)
    - My little research project, ultimately aiming to develop a C# scripting system for C++ apps
* [**BurekTech X**](https://github.com/Admer456/btx-engine) (early WiP, check back in 2024 if you wanna actually try it out)
    - MIT-licenced game engine for retro shooters

Some discontinued but still kinda neat projects:
* [**FoxGLBox**](https://github.com/Admer456/FoxGLBox)
    - OpenGL high-level rendering library
* [**BUREKTech**](https://github.com/Admer456/ioq3-burek)
    - GPL2-licenced engine for retro shooters, based on ioquake3
    - Was used to make a [game demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYP1LTfNuk&t=1668s)

Planned projects:
- Higher-level audio library using OpenAL-soft
- Generic plugin-based map editor with crazy ideas, suitable for Quake and Half-Life
- Lots of user-friendly modding tools for Half-Life
