I am currently studying at Faculty of Information Technologies in Mostar.

Check out my cool projects:
* [**Half-Life ADM**](https://github.com/Admer456/halflife-ADM) (massive cleanup in preparation)
    - Mod base for Half-Life, adding lots of entities for mappers
* [**FoxGLBox**](https://github.com/Admer456/FoxGLBox) (kinda inactive at the moment)
    - High-level rendering library
* [**BUREKTech**](https://github.com/Admer456/ioq3-burek) (inactive)
    - Fork of ioquake3; GPL2-licenced engine for boomer shooters
    - Was used to make a [game demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYP1LTfNuk&t=1668s)

Planned projects:
- Higher-level audio library using OpenAL-soft
- Plugin-based map editor for Quake, Half-Life (and whatever you write plugins for) with crazy ideas
- An MIT-licenced game engine for boomer shooters, with a workflow somewhat similar to Quake
