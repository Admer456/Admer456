Hey hey hey, welcome to my GitHub profile!

Check out my cool projects:
* [Nail & Crescent](https://github.com/Admer456/Nail-Crescent) (active)
    - A game inspired by Quake
    - A fork of Q2RTX that adds nice features for gamedev
* [BUREKTech 2](https://github.com/Admer456/burektech2) (on hiatus, currently focusing on other stuff)
    - GPL3-licenced game engine for boomer shooters
    - BUREKTech successor, fork of RBDoom3
    - Changes the engine to be more suitable for indie gamedev
* [BUREKTech](https://github.com/Admer456/ioq3-burek) (inactive)
    - Fork of ioquake3
    - GPL2-licenced engine for boomer shooters
    - Inspired by some GoldSRC and Source ideas
    - Was used to make a game demo
* [Half-Life ADM](https://github.com/Admer456/halflife-ADM) (active, depending on the time of the year)
    - Mod base for Half-Life, adding lots of entities for mappers
    - In the process of a major cleanup
* [FoxGLBox](https://github.com/Admer456/FoxGLBox) (active, occasionally worked on)
    - High-level rendering library

Planned projects:
* FoxALBox
    - High-level audio library using OpenAL-soft
* FoxPhysBox
    - Physics abstraction layer using Bullet Physics
* Codename Keksimil
    - Plugin-based map editor for Quake, Half-Life (and whatever you write plugins for) with crazy ideas
* Codename BX
    - An MIT-licenced game engine for boomer shooters
    - More or less the same workflow as Quake, GoldSRC, Source
    - But with much better tooling

Projects with the pattern `Fox[xyz]Box` are being developed mainly for Codename BX and Half-Life ADM. Projects with `Codename` mean that a name hasn't yet been chosen, so it might change.
