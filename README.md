I am currently studying software engineering at the [Faculty of Information Technologies](https://www.fit.ba/) in Mostar. I mainly do stuff in C++ and, as of lately, C#.

Check out my cool projects:
* [**Half-Life ADM**](https://github.com/Admer456/halflife-adm)
    - Mod base for Half-Life, adding lots of entities for mappers
* [**ScriptingMachine4**](https://github.com/Admer456/ScriptingMachine4)
    - My little research project, ultimately aiming to develop a C# scripting system for C++ apps
* [**Elegy Engine**](https://github.com/ElegyEngine) (early WiP, check back in 2024 for demos!)
    - C# MIT-licenced game engine for retro shooters, based on Godot

Some discontinued but still kinda neat projects:
* [**BurekTech X**](https://github.com/Admer456/btx-engine) - discontinued in favour of Elegy
    - C++ MIT-licenced game engine for retro shooters
* [**FoxGLBox**](https://github.com/Admer456/FoxGLBox)
    - OpenGL high-level rendering library in C++
* [**BUREKTech**](https://github.com/Admer456/ioq3-burek) - discontinued in favour of BurekTech X
    - C++ GPL2-licenced engine for retro shooters, based on ioquake3
    - Was used to make a [game demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYP1LTfNuk&t=1668s)

Planned projects:
- High-level audio library using MiniAudio as the backend
- Generic plugin-based map editor with crazy ideas, suitable for Quake and Half-Life
- Lots of user-friendly modding tools for Half-Life
