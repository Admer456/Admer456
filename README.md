Check out my cool projects:
* [**Nail & Crescent**](https://github.com/Admer456/Nail-Crescent) (active)
    - A game inspired by Quake; fork of Q2RTX that adds nice features for gamedev
* [**BUREKTech 2**](https://github.com/Admer456/burektech2) (on hiatus, currently focusing on other stuff)
    - BUREKTech successor, fork of RBDoom3
    - Changes the engine to be more suitable for indie gamedev
* [**BUREKTech**](https://github.com/Admer456/ioq3-burek) (inactive)
    - Fork of ioquake3; GPL2-licenced engine for boomer shooters
    - Was used to make a [game demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYP1LTfNuk&t=1668s)
* [**Half-Life ADM**](https://github.com/Admer456/halflife-ADM) (active, major cleanup in progress)
    - Mod base for Half-Life, adding lots of entities for mappers
* [**FoxGLBox**](https://github.com/Admer456/FoxGLBox) (active, occasionally worked on)
    - High-level rendering library

Planned projects:
* **FoxALBox**
    - High-level audio library using OpenAL-soft
* **FoxPhysBox**
    - Physics abstraction layer using Bullet Physics
* **Codename Keksimil**
    - Plugin-based map editor for Quake, Half-Life (and whatever you write plugins for) with crazy ideas
* **Codename BX**
    - An MIT-licenced game engine for boomer shooters
    - More or less the same workflow as Quake, GoldSRC, Source, but with much better tooling

(Projects with the pattern `Fox[xyz]Box` are being developed mainly for Codename BX and Half-Life ADM. Projects with `Codename` mean that a name hasn't yet been chosen, so it might change.)
