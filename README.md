My interests include game & engine programming, GUI tools, VR, making Half-Life modding great again, and a bunch of other non-code stuff, such as electronics, music and driving simulators.

I mainly do stuff in **C#** and **C++**. I am currently studying software engineering at the [Faculty of Information Technologies](https://www.fit.ba/) in Mostar, as well as doing some freelance work in Source and Godot.

Check out my cool projects:

    - C++, C#, MIT-licenced
    - Can be used in game engines, I'm currently using it to port Half-Life SDK to C#
